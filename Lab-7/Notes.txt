 Docker Registry: Push & Pull Images
âœ… Objectives:
Tag your custom image

Push it to Docker Hub (or a private registry if you prefer)

Pull it from the registry on another system or clean environment

ðŸ§° Tasks:
Log in to Docker Hub:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker login
Use your Docker Hub credentials.

If you donâ€™t have an account, create one here: https://hub.docker.com

Rebuild your Python Flask app image (from Lab 3) if needed:

Make sure youâ€™re in the app directory, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-python-app .
Tag the image with your Docker Hub username:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag my-python-app yourdockerhubusername/my-python-app:latest
Push the image to Docker Hub:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker push yourdockerhubusername/my-python-app:latest
Test it by pulling the image:

You can do this on the same machine after removing the local image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker rmi yourdockerhubusername/my-python-app:latest
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/my-python-app:latest
Run it again to verify:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 5000:5000 yourdockerhubusername/my-python-app:latest
