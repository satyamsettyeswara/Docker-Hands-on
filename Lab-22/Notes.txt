Docker Image Signing with cosign (by Sigstore)
🎯 Goal:
Sign your Docker images with a key.

Verify the image before pulling or running it.

🛠️ We'll Use: cosign
✅ Step 1: Install cosign
Ubuntu (using Go):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install -y golang-go
go install github.com/sigstore/cosign/v2/cmd/cosign@latest
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
Mac (Homebrew):

bash
Copy
Edit
brew install cosign
To check it’s installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
cosign version
✅ Step 2: Create a Key Pair for Signing
bash
Copy
Edit
cosign generate-key-pair
This generates:

cosign.key (private)

cosign.pub (public)

IMPORTANT: Never share cosign.key. Store it securely.

✅ Step 3: Tag and Push a Docker Image to Docker Hub (or another registry)
Let’s tag and push an image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag alpine <your-dockerhub-username>/alpine-signed
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/alpine-signed
✅ Step 4: Sign the Image
bash
Copy
Edit
cosign sign --key cosign.key <your-dockerhub-username>/alpine-signed
You’ll be prompted for a password (used to encrypt cosign.key).

✅ Step 5: Verify the Image Signature
bash
Copy
Edit
cosign verify --key cosign.pub <your-dockerhub-username>/alpine-signed
You’ll see something like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Verification for <image> -- success
✅ Boom — your image is now cryptographically signed and verifiable!
