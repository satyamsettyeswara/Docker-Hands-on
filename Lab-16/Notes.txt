 Create a Custom Docker Network and Connect Containers
🎯 Goal:
Create a custom Docker network.

Run multiple containers on it.

Test communication using container names (Docker DNS).

🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:
✅ Step 1: Create a Custom Bridge Network
bash
Copy
Edit
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
This creates a new network called my_custom_network using the bridge driver.

✅ Step 2: Run Two Containers on This Network
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -dit --name container1 --network my_custom_network alpine sh
docker run -dit --name container2 --network my_custom_network alpine sh
We're using the lightweight alpine image and starting a shell session with sh.

✅ Step 3: Test Communication Between Containers
bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it container1 ping container2
You should see output like:

python
Copy
Edit
PING container2 (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.079 ms
If this works, Docker DNS resolution within the custom network is working!
