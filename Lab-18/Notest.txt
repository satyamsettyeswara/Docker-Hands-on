Overlay Networks with Docker Swarm (Simulating Multi-Host Communication)
🎯 Goal:
Initialize Docker Swarm.

Create an overlay network.

Deploy services that can communicate across (simulated) nodes.

Even if you're on a single machine, you can still simulate overlay networking using Docker Swarm.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:
✅ Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm (if not already)
bash
Copy
Edit
docker swarm init
If Swarm is already initialized, you’ll see a message like “This node is already part of a swarm.”

✅ Step 2: Create an Overlay Network
bash
Copy
Edit
docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --attachable \
  my_overlay_network
The --attachable flag lets standalone containers (not just Swarm services) connect to this network.

✅ Step 3: Deploy a Service to the Overlay Network
bash
Copy
Edit
docker service create \
  --name overlay_test \
  --network my_overlay_network \
  --replicas 2 \
  alpine sleep 3600
This creates a service with 2 replicas of an alpine container sleeping for 1 hour.

✅ Step 4: Check That the Containers Are Running
bash
Copy
Edit
docker service ps overlay_test
You should see 2 tasks running on the node (even if it's just one physical machine, Swarm handles them as separate units).

✅ Step 5: Access a Task and Ping the Other
Find one of the running task containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps | grep overlay_test
Pick one of the container IDs and exec into it:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
Inside the container, try pinging the service name:

sh
Copy
Edit
ping overlay_test
You’ll see round-robin DNS working between replicas of the service.

Type exit to leave the container.
